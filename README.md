# Jigsaw
A React component library with Tailwind CSS for use in my personal projects.

## Development
This repo uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for component development and is packaged via [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup).

## Credits
Thanks to Alex Eagleson on dev.to for [his article on setting up a React component library](https://dev.to/alexeagleson/how-to-create-and-publish-a-react-component-library-2oe#adding-rollup) which helped me sort my Rollup configuration.
