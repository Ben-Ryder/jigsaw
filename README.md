# Jigsaw
A reusable React & Tailwind component library for use in my personal projects.

## Development
This repo was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) and uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
for component development.  
The component library package itself is then bundled via [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) and published to NPM
as `@ben-ryder/jigsaw`.
